    "Previously, we have used a vector of nodes to store the grid. It worked correctly because we accessed nodes by their index, and we didn't need complex lookups. But what happens when the number of nodes grows or when the aid aren't nicely packed into a range?  \n",

    "## Associative container `map` and `unordered map`\n",
    "That's when standard library gives us associative containers, like `map` and `unordered map`. An **associative container** is a type of data structure that stores elements in a way that allows fast look ups by key. It is like a phone book where you can look up 'John' and get his phone number, not based on position, but based on the name, which is **key** and the number is known as the **value**.\n",
