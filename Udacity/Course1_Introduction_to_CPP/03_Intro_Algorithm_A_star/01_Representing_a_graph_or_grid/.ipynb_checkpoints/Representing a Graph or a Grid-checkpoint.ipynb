    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a food carrier robot trying to navigate its way around a restaurant to get the food to the correct table. As it makes its way around the restaurant, the robot is passing many location and making choices. Our goal is to model these locations and code so we can search through them later. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common ways to represent a search space, a grid, which is like a 2D array, or a graph, which is like a set of nodes connected by edges. Choosing the right data structure will make your search algorithm faster and easier to write. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Grid\n",
    "Grids are great when movement is limited to a regular pattern, up, down, left, right. These patterns are in a simple path finding problems like moving in a maze or across a tiled map. In code a grid of rectangular spaces divided into walkable or blocked cells can be represented witha 2D array. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this grid, zero means walkable, and one means obstacle. You can move up, down, left or right, as long as the target cell is within bounds and not an obstacle. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A grid is perfect for problems where movement is regular and constrained. You can easily use row and column indices to check neighboring positions. But not all maps are grid. What if your robt can move diagonally, or what if some paths cost more than others? \n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is a collection of nodes, also called vertices and edges, which are connections between them. Each edge may have a cost or weight representing how far, how hard, or how expensive it is to move from one node to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/img_02.png\" alt=\"graph representation\" width=400 height=200 />\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, the node will be implemented on a `struct`, but it can be implemented as a classs\n",

    "struct node{\n",
    "    int id;      // this has to be unique. \n",
    "    int x, y;    // store the the nodes position on the map\n",
    "    float g = 0;    // actual cost from start. \n",
    "    float h = 0;    // heuristic cost to goal\n",
    "    float f = 0;    // total cost( g + h)\n",
    "    int parentId = -1    // previous node, this is considering it has only one parent. \n",

    "## What's a heuristic?\n",
    "A **Heuristic** is a **fast estimate** of the remaining cost to your goal. If you are looking at a map and you want to get one from one city to another city as you can, you can either exhaustively chek each road and highway, or you can make an educated guess. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In pathfinding/search, a heuristic is usually a function `h(n)` that estimates the **remaining cost** from a state/node `n` to the goal.\n",
    "- Example: on a 4-direction grid, **Manhattan distance** to the goal is a common heuristic; in A* you fuse `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)` (cost-so-far + estimate).\n"
