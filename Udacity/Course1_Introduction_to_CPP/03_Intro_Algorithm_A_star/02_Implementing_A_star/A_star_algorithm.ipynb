    "A star is one of the most widely used path-finding algorithms in games, robotics, and navigation systems. It finds the shortest path from a starting point to a goal and does it efficiently using a smart idea where we explore the paths that look more promising first. \n",
    "\n",
    "It does this by combinig two costs for each node, the actual cost to reach this nod from the start and the estimated cost from this node to the goal. We add these together to get the total cost, which will be our `f` score. \n",
    "\n",
    "To implement A*, we'll need to always select the node with the lowest `f`score, since this represents the node with the lowest total cost (easiest or closest). \n",

    "A priority queue is a smarter version of a regular queue. In a normal queue, elements come out in the order they went in, first in, first out. In a priority queue, the element with the highest priority comes out first. The standard library priority queue gives you the largest element by default, but we want the smallest `f` value instead. We can achieve this by creating a function that tells the queue how to rank elements.  \n",
